This paper presents a pipelineto multiplex the tracking and detection of a person in dynamic envi-ronments using a stereo camera in real-time. Recent developments inobject detection using ConvNets have led to robust person detection.These deep convolutional neural networks generally fail to run with highframes rates on devices with less computing power. Trackers are alsoused to retain the identity of the target person as well as imposefewerconstraints on hardware. A concept of multiplexed detection and track-ing is used which makes the pipeline faster by many folds. TurtleBot-2is used for prototyping the robot and tuning of the motion controller.Robot Operating System (ROS) is used to set up communication be-tween various nodes of the pipeline.

In order to carry out surveillance tasks like urban search and rescue operation, the ability to traverse stairs is of immense significance. This paper presents a deep learning based approach for semantic segmentation of stairs, behavioral cloning for stairalignment, and a novel mechanical design for an autonomous stair climbing robot. The main objective is to solve the problem of locomotion over staircases with the proposed implementation. Alignment of a robot with stairs in an image is a traditional problem,and the most recent approaches are centered around hand-crafted texture based Gabor filters and stair detection techniques. However, we could arrive at a more scalable and robust pipeline for alignment schemes. The proposed deep learning technique eliminates the need for manual tuning of parameters of the edge detector, the Hough accumulatorand PID constants. The empirical results and architecture of stair alignment pipeline are demonstrated in this paper.","tags":null,"title":"Deep Learning-Based Stair Segmentation and Behavioral Cloning for Autonomous Stair Climbing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Implementated:  DQN Vanilla Policy Gradient PPO DDPG  Results Value and Policy Iteration    Method Deterministic Frozen Lake Stochastic Frozen Lake     Value Iteration 7 8   Policy Iteration 7 3    Q-Learning Deep Q-Learning ","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"47bc177317798b160fa69ed8d5a232fa","permalink":"https://khush3.github.io/project/rl-implementation/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rl-implementation/","section":"project","summary":"Implementation of basic reinforcement learning algorithms.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Deep Learning"],"title":"Basics of Reinforcement Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"•Aimed at developing a wirelessly controlled robot capable of moving objects.\n•Developed a 3 DoF servo controlled arm with a gripper end effector for Pick-and-Place mechanism. •Used 2 Arduinos for controlling arm and motion independently.\n•Used a single channel relay for optimizing power consumption by switching off the arm when not in use.\nThis project was presented for AXIS(Technical Event at NIT-Nagpur), 2017 and was awarded a prize for innovative design.\nAbstract Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly and packing, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial goods.

Sign languages are expressed through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon. Unlike acoustically conveyed sound patterns, sign language uses body language and manual communication to fluently convey the thoughts of a person. It is achieved by simultaneously combining hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions. This way of communication is however limited to a group of people, which introduces a communication barrier. The need for a interpreter is essential to tackle this problem. A possible approach is using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This approach can, however, be costly and needs a bulky hardware setup or special application installation. Also, it is subject to lighting condition and perspective problems. We devised a cost-effective and easy-to-use glove that can overcome these limitations and act as a interpreter flawlessly.\n","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"32cbe4174f541f753e6fc5f2ca39f516","permalink":"https://khush3.github.io/project/sign-language/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sign-language/","section":"project","summary":"Wearable device to aid speech-impaired people.","tags":["Electronics","Embedded Systems"],"title":"Sign Language Translator","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"•Aimed at estimation equation of motion of a target-object video is selected to analyze its motion.\n•Aimed at retrieving data associated with the motion of tareget-object using elementary mathematics.\nThis project was made for TechnoSeason, 2017 and was awarded first prize.\nAbstract Simple harmonic motion can serve as a mathematical model for a variety of motions, such as the oscillation of a spring.
