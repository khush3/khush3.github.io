      <guid>https://khush3.github.io/project/terra-former-robot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;•Aimed at developing a wirelessly controlled robot capable of moving objects.&lt;br&gt;
•Developed a 3 DoF servo controlled arm with a gripper end effector for Pick-and-Place mechanism.
•Used 2 Arduinos for controlling arm and motion independently.&lt;br&gt;
•Used a single channel relay for optimizing power consumption by switching off the arm when not in use.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This project was presented for AXIS(Technical Event at NIT-Nagpur), 2017 and was awarded a prize for innovative design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly and packing, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial goods. A Robot equipped with a Pick-and-Place mechanism can be used for numerous applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sign Language Translator</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;•Aimed at providing aid for speech-impaired people.&lt;br&gt;
•Fabricated an easy-to-use, low-cost, and lightweight device in the form of a glove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description Sign languages are languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning. Sign languages are expressed through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon. Unlike acoustically conveyed sound patterns, sign language uses body language and manual communication to fluently convey the thoughts of a person. It is achieved by simultaneously combining hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions. This way of communication is however limited to a group of people, which introduces a communication barrier. The need for a commutator is essential to tackle this problem. A possible approach is using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This approach can, however, be costly and needs a bulky hardware setup or special application installation. Also, it is subject to lighting condition and perspective problems. We devised a cost-effective and easy-to-use glove that can overcome these limitations and act as a commutator flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Localization of a differential drive robot</title>
      <link>https://khush3.github.io/project/pose_estim/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://khush3.github.io/project/pose_estim/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;•Designed algorithm for pose (rectangular coordinates, angle) estimation of a
robot in a two dimensional plane using odometry, and developed the
hardware for robot.&lt;br&gt;
•Used ROS framework to establish communication between the nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robot localization is the process of determining where a mobile robot is located with respect to its environment. Localization is one of the most fundamental competencies required by an autonomous robot as the knowledge of the robot&amp;rsquo;s own location is an essential precursor to making decisions about future actions. In the summer of my freshman year, I worked on developing an algorithm to localize a differential-drive robot using odometry from scratch. Besides this, I also developed the hardware for the robot.&lt;/p&gt;
